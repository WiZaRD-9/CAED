Development of Lateral Surfaces of Solids

dev1. A rectangular prism of base size 25 mm x 40 mm and axis length 65 mm is resting on HP on its base
with the longer side of base inclined at 30 deg. to VP. It is cut by a plane inclined at 40 deg. to HP and
perpendicular to VP and passes through the extreme left corner of base. Draw the development of the
lateral surface of the remaining portion of the prism.

dev2. Draw the development of the truncated portion of the lateral faces of a pentagonal prism of 20 mm
sides of base and 50 mm height standing vertically with one of its rectangular faces parallel to VP and
nearer to it so as to produce a one piece development. The inclined face of the truncated prism is 30
deg. to its axis and passes through the right extreme corner of the top face of the prism. 

dev3. A square prism of 30 mm side of the base and height 50 mm is resting with its base on HP such that
one of its vertical faces is inclined at 40 deg. to VP. It is cut as shown in the following front view.
Draw the development of the lateral surface of the prism.

dev4. Draw the development of the following truncated cone

dev5. A pentagonal pyramid of 30 mm edges of base and 50 mm height rests vertically with one of its base
edges parallel to VP and nearer to it. It is cut as shown in figure. Draw the development of the lateral
surfaces of the upper portion of the pyramid

dev6.   A square pyramid base 40 mm side and axis 65 mm long has its base on HP and all the edges of the
base are equally inclined to VP. It is cut to with an inclined section plane so as the truncated surface at
45 deg. to its axis, bisecting it. Draw the development of the truncated pyramid.

dev7. A regular pentagonal pyramid of side of base 35 mm and altitude 65 mm has its base on HP with a
side of base perpendicular to VP. The pyramid is cut by a section plane which is perpendicular to the
VP and inclined at 30 deg. to HP. The cutting plane meets the axis of the pyramid at a point 30 mm
below the vertex. Obtain the development of the remaining part of the pyramid. 

dev8. A vertical cylinder of base diameter 45 mm and axis length 60 mm is cut by a plane perpendicular to
VP and inclined at 50 deg. to HP passing through the centre point of the top face. Draw the
development of the lateral surface of the cylinder.

upside. Draw the isometric projection of the combination of solids.

4. The frustum of a square pyramid of base 40 mm, top face 20 mm and height 60 mm rest on
